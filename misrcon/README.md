# Managertechteam's Python 3.x module and CLI for Miscreated RCON
I am not a (good) programmer, but I do try to learn more as I can. I hacked this together from multiple sources and a lot of trial and error. I hope you find it useful. Feel free to submit optimizations and bug fixes.
## Module usage example
### Python code
Note: For this example, the `misrcon.py` file was placed in the same directory as this code snippet.
```python
from misrcon import MiscreatedRCON

# This dictionary contains the required RCON connection information
rcon_config = {'host': '127.0.0.1',
               'port': 64094,
               'password': 'secret'}

# Create the RCON object using our config dictionary
this_rcon = MiscreatedRCON(**rcon_config)

# Send a command and assign the resulting dictionary to the 'result' variable
rcon_result = this_rcon.send_command(command='status')

# Print any returned errors
print('error: {0}'.format(rcon_result['error']))
# Print the boolean value for the success of the command
print('success: {0}'.format(rcon_result['success']))
# Print the returned value of the command as received from RCON
print('result: {0}'.format(rcon_result['returned']))
```

```
## Command-line (CLI) usage
### Executing against a locally running self-hosted Miscreated server
```bash
python3 misrcon.py -p secret -c "sv_chat This is a test... ignore me"
```
### Executing against a locally running self-hosted Miscreated server running on a non-default port (example: `-sv_port 54321`)
```bash
python3 misrcon.py --game-port 54321 -p secret -c "sv_chat This is a test... ignore me"
```
### Executing against a remote (ip address: `172.16.65.235`) Miscreated server with RCON listening on `64099`
```bash
python3 misrcon.py -s 172.16.65.235 --rcon-port 64099 -p secret -c "sv_chat This is a test... ignore me"
```
### Returned result from RCON for the above listed CLI usage examples
```
** Server: This is a test... ignore me **
```
